    text: "e enjoyed a lovely early dinner in Tuljak, it was raining, so we stayed inside. We had the starters platter for two, which was good, but very overpriced. Along with the chef's greetings (smoked pork and house made bread), this was of course too much as a starter Octopus as the main dish was nice, we were a bit puzzled though about the half empty plate...Ratatouille was also good, but could have benefitted from more vegetables then just zucchini As a dessert we ordered chocolate ice cream, but received mousse of chocolate instead, which was absolutely delicious! After we marked to the waitress that we ordered ice cream, she came back from the kitchen with the confirmation that it is indeed chocolate ice cream, but bit too chocolaty this time, go figure Service is very friendly, but a bit slow. All in all definitely worth visit, also quite child friendly",
